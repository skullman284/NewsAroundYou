# **NewsAroundYou** 
NewsAroundYou is an android news application that allows its users to read news articles from news sources all around the world, selected according to their chosen region and category. 
## **Description**
This application uses [News API](https://newsapi.org) to fetch news articles from the web and display them to the user based on their selected region and preferred categories. Firebase was used for the backend to allow user authentication and for its realtime database so that user data and preferences can be saved, and their favourite articles can be bookmarked. The application also allows users to change their region and categories, and share their chosen articles with their contacts through social media. A material design theme was implemented using java and XML for the front end. Built using android studio.
